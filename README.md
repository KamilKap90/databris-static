## Customization

### CSS

Custom styles extend Bootstrap through dedicated classes in `custom.css`. To modify:

1. Add new CSS classes rather than overriding Bootstrap defaults
2. Use Bootstrap's utilities where possible
3. Follow the established naming conventions

### JavaScript

The JavaScript is structured in modular components:

1. Core functionality in `custom.js`
2. Event handlers use delegation patterns
3. DOM manipulation is optimized for performance
